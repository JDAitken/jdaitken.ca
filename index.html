      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>
        I’m JD, a web developer-in-training based in Canada. I’m currently working through FreeCodeCamp, building small projects,
        and experimenting with HTML, CSS, and a bit of JavaScript.
      </p>
      <p>
        This site is part portfolio, part learning lab. I’m sharing what I can build right now — simple, clean starter sites and
        landing pages for personal projects and small businesses.
      </p>
      <p>
        My goal is to keep things minimal, fast, and easy to understand. No buzzwords, no overcomplication — just straightforward
        web pages that work.

      <h2>What I Can Build Right Now</h2>
      <p>I’m still learning, but here are the kinds of pages I’m comfortable building today:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>One-page personal sites</strong> – a simple homepage with your name, photo, bio, and contact link.</li>
        <li><strong>Basic 2–3 page small business sites</strong> – Home, Services, and Contact pages for things like dog walkers, barbers, trainers, or freelancers.</li>
        <li><strong>Landing pages</strong> – a focused page for a product, referral link, or promotion.</li>
        <li><strong>Starter portfolio pages</strong> – simple layouts to showcase a few projects or photos.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>As I learn more, I’ll expand this list and upgrade the projects you see here.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="projects">
      <h2>Practice Projects</h2>
      <p>These are practice projects I’m building as I learn. Some are simple, some are a bit experimental, but all of them are steps in getting better.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Dog Walker Landing Page</strong> – a clean one-page site for a local dog walker with services, pricing, and a contact button.</li>
        <li><strong>Barber Shop 3-Page Site</strong> – Home, Services, and Contact pages for a modern neighbourhood barbershop.</li>
        <li><strong>Fitness Coach Landing Page</strong> – a focused page with a hero section, transformation story, and “Book a Call” CTA.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>As I finish these, I’ll link live demos and code so you can see exactly what I’m working on.</p>
